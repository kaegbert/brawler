# brawler
game of the year edition

Dear Tyler,

hopefully this will help.

1. First off. Navigate download the zip from this page (top left)

![clone](https://github.com/kaegbert/brawler/blob/master/read_imgs/clone.png)

2. I recommend cloning it in terminal. You use command line but im pretty sure its the same process.

Download here:
http://git-scm.com/download/win

in command line you can type:

``` git clone https://github.com/kaegbert/brawler.git```

that will download an exact source of the folder on the web.
Later, you can pull or push (pull changes from the version online so if I make changes, or push your changes to the git page so I can pull them!)
