Dear Tyler,

hopefully this will help...

**Setup Git... kinda**

This is a not the best tutorial. If you want to learn how to use it on windows I recommend checking out a few tutorials on youtube.
***ZIP OR CLONE?***

1. **Zip** Download the zip from this page (top left)

![clone](https://github.com/kaegbert/brawler/blob/master/read_imgs/clone.png)

2. **Cloning** I recommend cloning it in terminal. You use command line but I'm pretty sure its the same process.

Download here:
http://git-scm.com/download/win

in command line you can type:

```
git clone https://github.com/kaegbert/brawler.git
```

That will download an exact source of the folder on the web to *your working directory*.
Later, you can pull or push (pull changes from the version online so if I make changes, or push your changes to the git page so I can pull them!)

If you don't want to do the command line bs, you can just download the zip and work that way. Also, I haven't used the git client but some people like it.
